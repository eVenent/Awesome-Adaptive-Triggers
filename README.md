## About
> Adaptive triggers are a feature in modern gaming controllers, most notably in the PlayStation DualSense controller for the PlayStation 5 (PS5). They use built-in motors to provide variable levels of resistance and feedback on the controller's triggers (L2 and R2 buttons). This feature enhances immersion in gameplay by simulating the physical sensations of in-game actions.

### How They Work
Adaptive triggers adjust their tension dynamically based on the game. The controller's software and hardware interact to create resistance that corresponds to the in-game context. For example:

- **Drawing a Bowstring**: The resistance increases as you pull the trigger, mimicking the tension of a bowstring.
- **Shooting a Gun**: The trigger may "lock up" or provide a jolt to simulate recoil or jamming.
- **Driving Over Different Surfaces**: The trigger resistance might change to reflect the type of terrain, like smooth resistance on asphalt and a bumpy sensation on gravel.

### Key Benefits
- **Enhanced Immersion**: Players feel more connected to the game through realistic tactile feedback.
- **Contextual Feedback**: Different levels of resistance add a layer of gameplay depth and realism.
- **Game-Specific Integration**: Developers can customize trigger behavior for specific game actions, making each title unique.
